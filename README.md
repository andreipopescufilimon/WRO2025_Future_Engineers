**Age:** 16
**High School:** International Computer High School Bucharest (ICHB)  

**Description:**  
Hi! I’m Andrei from Romania, and this is my fifth WRO season. This is my first season in Future Engineers, as before I competed in Robomission category. I am passionate about robotics especially electronics and latest algorithms and tech. Over the years, I have worked on multiple robotics projects, including line followers, sumo bots, and air quality modules. Apart from robotics, I also enjoy videography, programming, and cycling.
