# electrical-schematics - Electrical Schematics

This folder contains the circuit diagrams and wiring layouts for the robot's electronics. Also we added the 3 files needed for PCB production with assembly at JLCPCB.


- `Schematic_Chassis.png`: Schematic of the chassis PCB
- `PCB_traces.jpg`: PCB as the view with cooper traces on EasyEDA Pro
- `PCB_board.jpeg`: Photo with the PCB after production

**Production Files:**
- `BOM_Board1_FE_NerdvanaTaurus_Chassis_2025-08-08.csv`: Assembly Placement
- `Gerber_FE_NerdvanaTaurus_Chassis_2025-08-08.zip`: PCB Production File
