# 3D-models - 3D Models

This folder contains 3D design files for the robot's components. These files include parts used in the vehicle's steering and drivebase. Formats include STL and/or STEP files.

### Models
- `back-rings-for-differential-to-wheel-axles.stl`: used to place and support the differential bearing and the two wheels with axle
- `back-wheel.stl`: back wheel with axle to attach to differential
- `drive-motor-support-with-battery.stl`: drive motor support with battery placed on top of it
- `front-wheel.stl`: front wheel
- `impeller-base.stl`: impeller fixed part, the support keeping the motor
- `impeller-fan.stl`: impeller fan used for suction
- `openmv-camera-mounts.stl`: the 2 90deg mounts used to place the openmv camera to the chassis
- `pinion-differential.stl`: the pinion used to drive the differential
- `servo-to-wheel-hub-fixed-bar.stl`: fixed bar used to fix the 2 screws on which the steering hubs move
- `steering-left-hub.stl`: left hub used to attach the wheel for the steering
- `steering-right-hub.stl`: right hub used to attach the wheel for the steering
- `steering-servo-to-hub-bar.stl`: steering bar the moves with the servo to turn left and right

### Archive
- `old-3D-models/`: Contains earlier versions of the robot's 3D models for reference.

## Usage
- Download the `.stl` or `.step`(if available) files to fabricate the components using a 3D printer or CNC machine.
- Ensure the parts are assembled according to the robot's full assembled design.
