# 3D-models - 3D Models

This folder contains 3D design files for the robot's components. These files include parts used in the vehicle's steering and drivebase. Formats include STL and/or STEP files.

## Contents

### Main Models
- `chassisV2.stl`: Updated chassis design for the robot.
- `gear-Daxle.stl`: Gear for the drive motor axle.
- `motor-bracket.stl`: Mounting bracket for the motor.
- `openmv-camera-mount.stl`: Camera mount for the OpenMV camera.
- `steering-connect-bar.stl`: Connecting bar for the steering mechanism to the servo.
- `steering-left-small-bar.stl`: Left side small mount steering bar.
- `steering-right-small-bar.stl`: Right side small mount steering bar.
- `wheel-mount-left.stl`: Left wheel mounting component.
- `wheel-mount-right.stl`: Right wheel mounting component.

### Archive
- `old-3D-models/`: Contains earlier versions of the robot's 3D models for reference.

## Usage
- Download the `.stl` or `.step`(if available) files to fabricate the components using a 3D printer or CNC machine.
- Ensure the parts are assembled according to the robot's full assembled design.
